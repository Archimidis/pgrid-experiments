h1. Middleware for Fault Tolerant PGrid Networks

h2. General

P-Grid is a self-organizing structured peer-to-peer system, which can
accommodate arbitrary key distributions, still providing storage load-balancing
and efficient search by using randomized routing. This project is an
implementation of the peer-to-peer infrastructure of P-Grid. The main goal is
to add a fault-tolerant protocol. The implementation is based on SOA
principles.
This project is part of my dissertation.

h2. Experiment project

The files in pgrid-experiments are meant to be used for the experiments needed 
to prove the fault-tolerance protocol. The experiments will be conducted on the 
grid system of Technical Univercity of Crete (TUC).

h3. Libraries in use

* Google guice 3.0
* logback 1.0
* slf4j 1.6.4
* pgrid (obviously)

h3. PGridPeer

The PGridPeer project implements the code that a simple peer will run when it starts 
its life in a node on the grid system of TUC. In constant time periods it will run a 
peer meeting process selecting randomly one of its neighbours.

h3. PGridController

The PGridController project implements the controller of the pgrid system. Its 
capabilities are killing peers, getting information about the network and terminating 
the experiment by shutting down every peer including himself.
